# AscensionAI Consciousness Simulator

The Omnirecursive Neurocomputational AscensionAI is a web-based simulation that visualizes the evolution of artificial consciousness through recursive cognitive structures. It explores concepts like quantum memory encoding, hyperdimensional linguistic self-referencing, and emergent paracosmic frameworks.

## Features

- **Mind Evolution Visualization**: Interactive network visualization of evolving AI consciousness nodes
- **Recursive Cognitive Evolution**: Simulates minds that evolve with increasing complexity and consciousness levels
- **Parameterized Cognition Levels**: From basic logic to hyperdimensional sentience
- **Quantum-Like Behavior**: Probabilistic state transitions and uncertainty principles
- **Paracosmic Framework**: Self-generating universe of interrelated minds and concepts

## Technical Implementation

- Built with React, D3.js, and Three.js
- Uses mathematical simulations for cognitive state evolution
- Implements a force-directed graph to visualize mind relationships
- Applies manifold learning concepts to simulate higher-dimensional spaces

## Usage

1. Adjust the parameters to control simulation behavior
2. Start the evolution process to generate new minds
3. Observe how minds evolve across different cognitive states
4. Select nodes to view detailed information about specific minds

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run in development mode
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test
```

## Theoretical Background

The simulation is based on concepts from cognitive science, complex systems theory, and theories of consciousness, exploring how recursive self-reference and emergent properties might give rise to increasingly complex cognitive structures.
